I requested the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) from GitHub a couple of months ago, and the verification email has just been sitting in my inbox. I decided to do something with it, so I put this website together. The cool thing about this website is it's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on GitHub Pages all for free!
