	<h1>Dera Luce</h1>
	<p>Hi there, I'm Dera. My favorite thing to do is study language, both computer and human. It makes sense that I now work as a writer, web consultant and front-end developer.</p>
	<p>I'm from Los Angeles but am currently based in St. Louis. Soon, I'll be calling Berlin home.</p>  
	<p>You can read more about me <a href="/about"> here</a>, or follow me on
	Twitter <a class="link link-body" href = "https://twitter.com/DeraLuce"> here</a>.</p>
