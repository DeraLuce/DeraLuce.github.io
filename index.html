	<p>Hi there. I'm Dera, a St. Louis-based writer and <a href ="http://360.wustl.edu/author/dera-ikeme/"> student </a> 
	by way of Los Angeles. I once captivated an entire room of people with a single utterance. 
	An infant's first word is pretty exciting, I guess. I've expanded my vocabulary since then (in several languages), and 
	now I love using words to tell stories. You can read more about me <a href="/about"> here.</a></p>
