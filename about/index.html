<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p> My story is that I enjoy telling other people's stories. Many of these people come from my imagination. 
(That's a sentence that will probably bring weird looks if I don't preface it by saying I write fiction.) 
I also enjoy journalism and the way it connects strangers all over the world. There are a lot of other ways to connect 
strangers (maybe you've heard of Tinder?), but journalism is a form that educates as well.</p>
<p>I love words and language. Besides English, I also speak Spanish and Japanese. Of course, 
learning is a constant process, and I'm always seeking to practice and improve my multilingual skills.
Starting September 2015, I'll be studying in Kyoto, Japan for 8 months. </p>
