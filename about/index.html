<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>When you're looking for someone to create your website, you want someone who is creative but doesn't have their head in the clouds. You want someone who still pays attention to detail. I'm a writer with a long history of theater and acting. I've also been making websites since I was in middle school, and I received formal computer science training in university. What a combo, right?</p>
<p>Whether you need someone who is creative or analytical, I've got you covered.</p>
<p>I love words and language. Besides English, I also speak Spanish and Japanese, and I'm learning German. Of course, 
learning is a constant process, and I'm always seeking to practice and improve my multilingual skills.</p>
<p>I've lived in many places, including Los Angeles, St. Louis and Kyoto. Starting May 2018, I'll be living in Berlin. I look forward to immersing myself
in a new culture. </p>
