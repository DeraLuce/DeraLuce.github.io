<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p> My story is that I enjoy telling other people's stories. Many of these people come from my imagination, since 
I write fiction.
I also enjoy journalism and the way it connects strangers all over the world. There are plenty of other ways to connect 
strangers (maybe you've heard of Tinder?), but journalism is a form that educates as well.</p>
<p>I love words and language. Besides English, I also speak Spanish and Japanese. Of course, 
learning is a constant process, and I'm always seeking to practice and improve my multilingual skills.
Starting September 2015, I'll be studying in Kyoto, Japan for 8 months. I look forward to immersing myself
in a new culture. And yes, I'll take pictures
of a <a href ="http://time.com/2280/heres-an-inside-look-at-japans-best-cat-cafes/"> cat cafe </a> or two, just for you. </p>
